# Plant Disease Detection - Final Year Project

This project focuses on detecting plant diseases using machine learning techniques. It aims to assist farmers and agricultural professionals in identifying plant diseases early to improve crop yield and quality.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project can be downloaded from Kaggle:  
[PlantVillage Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohitsingh1804/plantvillage/code)

The dataset contains labeled images of healthy and diseased plants, which are used to train and evaluate the machine learning model.
